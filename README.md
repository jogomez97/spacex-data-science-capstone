# Space X Data Science Capstone
This project is a part of the Applied Data Science Capstone from the [IBM Data Science professional certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro
In this capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. 

## Project Objectives
* Use data science methodologies to define and formulate a real-world business problem.
* Use data analysis tools to load a dataset, clean it, and find out interesting insights from it.
* Use data visualization skills to visualize the data and extract meaningful patterns to guide the modeling process.
* Build a dashboard to analyze launch records interactively with Plotly Dash.
* Build an interactive map to analyze the launch site proximity with Folium.
* Split the data into training testing data.
* Train different classification models.
* Hyperparameter grid search.
* Use your machine learning skills to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently.
